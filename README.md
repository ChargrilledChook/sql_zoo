# SQL Zoo

An assignment for The Odin Project to practice SQL.

[Lesson Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/databases/lessons/sql) from The Odin Project.

[SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) exercises.

## Musings

Feel reasonably comfortable with the basics of SQL after these exercises but still plenty to learn.
Not particularly comfortable with self joins or window functions (beyond the basics), or combinations of the more complex operations together
ie deeply nested selects with the above two, etc.

Have enough of the basics to move on for now but probably good to revist as needs dictate.
